# Private Repo for GitOps with ArgoCD

This repository is designed to enable deployment and GitOps workflows using ArgoCD with a private GitHub repository. It includes all necessary manifests and configurations such as Application, RBAC ConfigMap, ConfigMap, and Secrets for authentication tokens to access the private GitHub repo.

## Overview

This repo enables GitOps deployment using ArgoCD by:

- Defining an ArgoCD Application (`application.yaml`) that points to this repo for continuous synchronization.
- Configuring ArgoCD with custom RBAC policies (`argocd-rbac-cm.yaml`) to manage access.
- Using `argocd-cm.yaml` for ArgoCD configuration adjustments.
- Managing GitHub authentication securely via `argocd-secrets.yaml` which contains the token to access the private GitHub repository.
- Deploying Kubernetes manifests for the application and its dependencies in the `k8s/` folder.
- Automating deployment and cleanup with `run.sh` and `delete.sh` scripts respectively.

---

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster with ArgoCD installed and running.
- Access to the private GitHub repository with a valid personal access token (PAT) or deploy key.
- `kubectl` configured to interact with your cluster.
- Necessary permissions to create namespaces, secrets, configmaps, and applications in ArgoCD.

---

## Usage

### Deploy all resources

Run the following command to deploy the entire setup including ArgoCD configurations and your application:

```
./run.sh
```

This script applies all manifests and configures ArgoCD to sync with this private repo.

### Delete all resources

To clean up and delete all deployed resources, run:

```
./delete.sh
```

This will remove the ArgoCD application, secrets, configmaps, and all Kubernetes resources deployed by this repo.

---

## ArgoCD Application Configuration

The `application.yaml` manifest defines the ArgoCD Application resource that:

- Points to this private GitHub repo.
- Uses the secret defined in `argocd-secrets.yaml` for authentication.
- Syncs the Kubernetes manifests under the `k8s/` directory.
- Targets the appropriate cluster and namespace for deployment.

---

## RBAC and Security

- `argocd-rbac-cm.yaml` configures fine-grained access control for ArgoCD users and teams.
- `argocd-secrets.yaml` securely stores the GitHub token required to access the private repository.
- Ensure that your GitHub token has the minimum required scopes (typically `repo` and `read:org`) for security best practices.

---

## Notes

- Customize the manifests as per your environment and application requirements.
- Keep your GitHub token secure and avoid committing it directly to public repositories.
- The scripts `run.sh` and `delete.sh` simplify deployment and teardown but review them before use to ensure they fit your cluster policies.

Thank you for reviewing this GitOps setup. This repository demonstrates a professional approach to managing Kubernetes deployments with ArgoCD using a private GitHub repository.
